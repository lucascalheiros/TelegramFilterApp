This is an utilitary app built with [TdLib](https://core.telegram.org/tdlib) to filter messages and emmit notifications based on a custom criteria defined by the user.

The ideia for this app started just as a desire to filter some black friday deals from deals channels from telegram. Initially the idea was to create a Filter Bot, unfortunately the Bot's are unable to subscribe to channels
and access messages, so the idea for a filter companion app emerged, this is a fairly simple app, but well constructed and architected a part of my showcase projects (checkout for a different architecture and tech stack https://github.com/lucascalheiros/Showcase-App-WaterReminder)

## Build

To build this application properly you will need to have:

* **Valid SetTdlibParameters**: Follow the instructions on https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id to obtain an api_id, and set the required parameters from this file `data/src/main/java/com/github/lucascalheiros/data/frameworks/telegram/SetTdlibParameters.kt`
* **Google Services json**: You will need to setup a firebase project following this guide https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup#console to replace `app/google-services.json`

After that you may as well provide the FCM credential to the app you created on the telegram setup https://my.telegram.org/apps and then just press the run button on the Android Studio.

## Technologies

* UI: Compose, Material, SplashScreen API, Jetpack Navigation 
* Async: Coroutines
* Reactive: Flow/Channels
* Storage: Room
* Dependency Injecntion: Hilt/Dagger
* Firebase: Crashlytics, Analytics, FCM
* Tests: Junit, Mockk, Roboeletric
* Relevant architectures: MVI+Reducer, Clean Architecture, Modular, Single Activity app
* TdLib

## Architecture

### UI Layer Architecture: MVI with a Reducer for State Management

This app adopts the MVI (Model-View-Intent) architecture for the UI layer, with a Reducer to handle state management. Each screen includes the following core components and their responsibilities:

1. **UiState**  
   An immutable data class representing the complete state of the view at any given time.

2. **UiEvents**  
   An enum-like structure to emit low-priority, single-use events. High-priority or persistent events are better represented as part of the `UiState` and handled manually.

3. **Intents**  
   An enum-like structure representing all user actions while interacting with the UI. Intents are dispatched to the `ViewModel` to trigger state changes, produce events, or interact with the app's domain logic.

4. **Actions**  
   An enum-like structure representing the final actions that update the state.

5. **Reducer**  
   A pure function that receives an `Action` and the current `UiState` and produces a resultant state.

6. **ViewModel**  
   This is the familiar Android `ViewModel` component. In this architecture, it:  
   - Holds the `UiState` and `UiEvents` flows.  
   - Exposes the intent dispatcher function.  
   - Maps the `Intents` into `Actions`.  
   - Acts as middleware between the domain and the reducer, calling domain functions required by `Intents` and generates `Actions` to update the screen state.

#### Advantages of Using a Reducer in MVI

The Reducer enhances the separation of concerns, simplifying testing and maintenance:  
- **Improved Separation of Concerns**: State change logic is isolated in the Reducer, keeping the `ViewModel` smaller and easier to manage over time.  
- **Ease of Testing**: As a pure function, the Reducer makes testing straightforward, with `Action` â†’ `State` transitions being explicit and predictable.

---

##### Considerations and Trade-offs

While the Reducer brings structural benefits, it also introduces some boilerplate:  
- **Boilerplate Code**: Implementing the `Reducer` and `Actions` involves additional setup compared to managing state changes directly in the `ViewModel`.  
- **Complexity for Simple Scenarios**: For straightforward cases, this approach might feel overly elaborate.

### App Architecture: Modular Clean Architecture

Since this is a very simple app I opted for a simple layered modularization with 3 major modules and other minors modules. For a more granular modularization please checkout: https://github.com/lucascalheiros/Showcase-App-WaterReminder which uses modularization based in features and separated domain/data modules.

* **app**: Application entrypoint and UI layer
* **domain**: Pure kotlin module responsible for the domain layer (business rules)
* **data**: Data layer, responsible for the interaction with external frameworks and storage.

This is a domain driven architecture, so both `app` an `data` modules will depend on `domain` module, and the `app` module will have no direct interaction with classes from the `data` module, with exception to enable the dependency injection.

As Additional minor modules:
* **analytics**: Following best practices to share analytics and crashlytics capabilities to other modules
* **common**: Some utilitary functions, logs and dispatcher qualifiers
